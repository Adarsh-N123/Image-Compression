# Image Compression with K-means Clustering

This repository demonstrates how to use the K-means clustering algorithm for image compression. The K-means algorithm is applied to group similar pixels together and represent them using a reduced set of representative values. The compressed image has a smaller file size while maintaining visual quality.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
