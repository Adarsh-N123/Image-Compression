# Image Compression with K-means Clustering

This repository demonstrates how to use the K-means clustering algorithm for image compression. The K-means algorithm is applied to group similar pixels together and represent them using a reduced set of representative values. The compressed image has a smaller file size while maintaining visual quality.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Original Image
![Alt Text](original.png)

### Compressed Image
![Alt Text](compressed.png)

## Evaluation
 - initial size of the original image is 625 kb
 - final size after compression is 196 kb

## Possible Future Updates
 - PDF compression
 - Image segmentation
 - Using images segmentation and ocr to read data from PDF

## Image Segmentation

## Segmentation with RGB format
- k=
